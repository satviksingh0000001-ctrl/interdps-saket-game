click on 
'inter dps game by satvik,shaurya,dharya,faiz'
then read the read me file in the folder to run the game.

*KINDLY DO NOT TOUCH OR EDIT ANY OTHER FILE THAN THE README FILE AS IT COULD REALLY MAKE THE GAME UNABLE TO RUN.
DOWNLOAD THE FULL ZIP FILE WITH ALL THE FILES UPLOADED OR ELSE THE GAME WOULD NOT RUN WITHOUT ALL ITS REQUIRED RESOURCES.

this game only works in windows 10 or 11
extract the game from zip file first.

README

to run the game:

1 you need to have at least python 3 installed 

2 you need to install py game module 
  (if you don't), paste this command in cmd  "pip install pygame" OR just run the requirement.txt file in cmd by changing your directory to the downloaded game file with "cd" command.

3 now finally run, "play game.bat" file in the game folder ie. "inter dps game by satvik,shaurya,dharya,faiz"

controls:
you can use arrow keys to control selected character's movement
all control are written in the ui.
*save data is saved character wise that you sleect in-game in the "saved_characters"
file you can delete the files in that folder to delete save data and reset progress.
hope it helps :)

we have divided the game in different py files as it was too big to be made in on piece and we all have worked on this game separately by mixing the separately made game file together.


this game isn't demanding or that challenging however, we hope that the dps saket team enjoys this playtime.
